- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sterling
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in finance and investing and how I can use Python and SQL to optimize both. I've worked for 7 years in finance now and want to add some coding skills. I have a certificate in Financial Planning from the College of Financial Planning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently completing free Code Camp's curriculum and will showcase my projects here.
