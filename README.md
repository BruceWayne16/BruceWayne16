- 👋 Hi, I’m Sterling
- 👀 I’m interested in finance and investing and how I can use Python and SQL to get better at both of them. I work in finance now and want to add some coding skills. I routinely sell options for side income, specifically Iron Condors on SPX and XSP. It worked great in some environments (low volatility, obviously) and terrible in other environments (earnings, Fed days, increased volatility). My goal is to build something that can formalize the daily decision making of whether or not to sell condors that day and how wide of a margin to make the short strikes.
