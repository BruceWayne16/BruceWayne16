- Hi, I’m Sterling
- I love finance and investing and learning how I can use Python, Pandas, and NumPy to optimize both. I've worked for 7 years in finance now and want to add some coding skills. I have a certificate in Financial Planning from the College of Financial Planning.
- I’m currently completing free Code Camp's Python curriculum and will showcase my projects here.
